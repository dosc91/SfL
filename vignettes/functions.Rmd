The `SfL` package was created to accompany the [Statistics for Linguistics](https://forensic-linguistics-sc.com/workshop/) online workshop in August/September 2021. The workshop was a satellite event to the [3rd Forensic Linguistics Short Course](https://forensic-linguistics-sc.com/).

This vignette gives an overview of functions included in the `SfL` package. Please refer to the [data set vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dosc91/SfL/blob/main/vignettes/data_sets.html) for an overview of included data sets.

# Overview

This is a full list of all functions currently contained in `SfL`:

- [correlation_matrix](#correlation_matrix)
- [create_error_bar_df](#create_error_bar_df)
- [open_exercises](#open_exercises)
- [predictor_competition](#predictor_competition)
- [tukey](#tukey)

Where necessary, the `data_s` data set will be used for illustrations in this vignette.

```{r}
data("data_s")
```

# Create Correlation Matrix {#correlation_matrix}

The `correlation_matrix` function creates a matrix of scatter plots with Pearson and Spearman correlations in the lower triangle. It is a wrapper for `languageR::pairscor.fnc`.

The function takes a data set and a vector of column (variable) names to display in the plot.

```{r fig.align='center'}
correlation_matrix(data = data_s, variables = c("typeOfS", "pauseBin", "sDur"))
```

# Create Error Bar Dataframe {#create_error_bar_df}

The `create_error_bar_df` function creates a dataframe with which a `ggplot2` bar plot (`geom_bar`) with error bars (+/- 1 standard deviation) can easily be created.

The function takes an original data set, a numerical value to summarise, and one or more categorical variables as arguments. </br>
Additionally, the user may specify whether they want to compute the standard deviation (default) or standard error, and whether they wish to compute the base standard deviation/error (default) or a multiple of that, e.g. two times the standard deviation.

```{r include=T, eval=T}
# example 1: one categorical variable

df1 <- create_error_bar_df(data = data_s, numerical = "sDur", factors = "pauseBin")

df1
```


```{r include=T, eval=T}
# example 2: more than one categorical variable

df2 <- create_error_bar_df(data = data_s, numerical = "sDur", factors = c("pauseBin", "typeOfS", "folType"))

df2
```


```{r include=T, eval=T}
# example 3: double standard deviation

df3 <- create_error_bar_df(data = data_s, numerical = "sDur", factors = "pauseBin", size = 2)

df3
```


```{r include=T, eval=T}
# example 4: standard error instead of standard deviation

df4 <- create_error_bar_df(data = data_s, numerical = "sDur", factors = "pauseBin", type = "std")

df4
```


---

# Open Exercise {#open_exercises}

The `open_exercises` function opens the knitted RMarkdown associated with a session of the Statistics for Linguistics Workshop as html file in the system's standard browser.

The function takes a session number as argument. Skipping the zero, e.g. writing `2` instead of `02`, works as well.

```{r eval=F}
open_exercises(02)
```

# Compare Variables for Predictor Strength {#predictor_competition}

The `predictor_competition` function is used to compare the predictive strength of two independent variables. The function creates two identical lmer objects, only differing in fixed effects structure. Then, a log-likelihood test is used to decide which fixed effect structure is better fit to predict the dependent variable.

The function takes a number of arguments as input, i.e. the original data set, the dependent variable for both models, the independent variables to test, a random intercept variable, and (if specified) a random slope variable.

```{r}
# example 1: two similarly well fit predictors
predictor_competition(data = data_s, dependent = "sDur", 
                      independent1 = "typeOfS", independent2 = "pauseBin", 
                      random.intercept = "speaker")

# example 2: one predictor is better than the other
predictor_competition(data = data_s, dependent = "sDur", 
                      independent1 = "typeOfS", independent2 = "slideNumber", 
                      random.intercept = "speaker")
```


---

# Tukey Contrasts {#tukey}

The tukey function computes Tukey Contrasts for all levels of a categorical predictor. 

The function takes simple and multiple linear regression models, as well as linear mixed effects regression models as input. Specify the categorical predictor for which Tukey contrasts should be computed.

```{r}
simple_lm <- lm(sDur ~ typeOfS, data = data_s)
tukey(model = simple_lm, predictor = typeOfS)

multiple_lm <- lm(sDur ~ typeOfS + pauseBin, data = data_s)
tukey(model = multiple_lm, predictor = pauseBin)

# library(lme4)
mixed_lm <- lmer(sDur ~ typeOfS + pauseBin + folType + (1 | speaker), data = data_s, REML = F)
tukey(model = mixed_lm, predictor = folType)
```
